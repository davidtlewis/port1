PLAN

Create new historic_price table. (sturcture as per yahoo)
Create new stock_dividend table (date, per share return, possibly return given holding)
Create new fund_performance table (not sure of structure) - applies for ETS and funds - not stocks but I only have unilver and llopyds pref
Add yahoo ticker symbol to stock table (ate	Open	High	Low	Close*	Adj. close**, )

call function on stock object to populate historic_price between given periods
    call yahoo page, loop through creating price, and dividend records
    (this is called manually to catch up, then a perhaps weekly task does a catch up from last date to now )

Call function on stock to refresh fund_performance
    timestamp, measure (list of allowed values), value, category value) - probably Trailing returns (%) vs. Benchmarks and per annum Annual total return (%) 
    Management function calls this infrequently
    No point in refreeshing the annual at allowed
